# context-lens

Context window quality monitoring for LLM applications.

Everyone managing LLM context windows truncates blind. Token count is the only signal. But context has *quality* — coherence, density, relevance, continuity — and quality degrades in predictable, detectable ways long before the window fills up.

context-lens measures what token counting can't.

## Features

- **Segments** — model your context window as structured, trackable units of meaning
- **Quality scoring** — four dimensions scored from structural signals, no LLM calls required
- **Degradation detection** — five named patterns (saturation, erosion, fracture, gap, collapse) with severity levels and remediation hints
- **Custom patterns** — register domain-specific degradation patterns that plug into the same detection framework
- **Eviction advisory** — ranked recommendations for what to remove, with protection tiers, impact estimates, and strategy awareness
- **Task identity** — set a task descriptor and watch relevance scores shift as context drifts from the current goal
- **Fleet monitoring** — aggregate quality across multiple instances for multi-agent setups
- **Observability export** — optional OpenTelemetry adapter for quality metrics and pattern events
- **Serialization** — snapshot and restore instance state for recovery, replay, and export
- **Report schema** — JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for all output types, consumable by any language or tool

## Quick start

```typescript
import { ContextLens } from 'context-lens';

const lens = new ContextLens({ capacity: 8000 });

// Seed with foundational context
lens.seed([
  { content: 'You are a helpful assistant.', protection: 'pinned' },
  { content: 'The user prefers concise answers.' },
]);

// Add conversation turns
lens.add('User: Summarize the Q3 report.');
lens.add('Assistant: Q3 revenue grew 12% driven by enterprise subscriptions.');

// Assess quality
const report = lens.assess();
console.log(report.windowScores);   // { coherence, density, relevance, continuity }
console.log(report.composite);      // 0.0–1.0, null if empty
console.log(report.patterns);       // active degradation patterns

// Set a task to enable relevance scoring
await lens.setTask({ description: 'Summarize Q3 financial results' });

// Get eviction recommendations when context fills up
const plan = lens.planEviction({ targetTokens: 200 });
for (const candidate of plan.candidates) {
  console.log(candidate.id, candidate.evictionScore, candidate.recommendation);
}
```

## Architecture

One instance, one window. Caller-driven mutations — context-lens never auto-evicts, auto-compacts, or auto-reorders. It measures and advises.

**Quality model:** Four dimensions (coherence, density, relevance, continuity) scored independently from structural signals — adjacency similarity, redundancy detection, task descriptor matching, and cumulative loss tracking. No LLM inference. Similarity computed via Jaccard character trigrams (zero-config) or embeddings (optional provider).

**Detection:** Five base patterns classify quality degradation. Three severity levels with hysteresis to prevent flicker. Six compound patterns identify multi-dimensional crises. Custom patterns register at construction or runtime.

**Eviction advisory:** Five-signal weighted ranking (relevance, density, coherence contribution, importance, age). Four protection tiers enforced as walls: default < priority(n) < seed < pinned. Strategy auto-selected from active patterns. Groups evicted atomically.

**Performance budget:** Queries < 1ms, mutations < 5ms, assessment < 50ms, planning < 100ms at n <= 500, excluding provider latency. O(n^2) bottlenecks managed by sampling at n > 200.
